# Emoji Presets for Common Themes

A curated collection of pre-defined emoji sets for popular occasions and
themes. These presets provide quick access to thematically appropriate
emojis without having to manually select and combine them. Use with
[`emoji_shower_ui()`](https://ineelhere.github.io/shiny.emojirain/reference/emoji_shower_ui.md)
via `emojis = emoji_presets()$theme_name` or extract individual presets
as needed.

## Usage

``` r
emoji_presets()
```

## Value

character vector of emoji strings ready to use with
[`emoji_shower_ui()`](https://ineelhere.github.io/shiny.emojirain/reference/emoji_shower_ui.md).
Available presets:

- `christmas`: Holiday-themed emojis (Christmas tree, Santa, snowman,
  gifts, bells, sparkles, snowflakes, confetti)

  vampire, wizard, candle)

## Details

### Why Use Presets?

Presets save time and ensure thematically consistent animations. Instead
of manually curating emoji lists, you can simply use a preset matching
your occasion. Each preset has been selected to work well together
visually.

### Customization

Presets are just starting points! You can:

- Combine emojis from multiple presets

- Add custom emojis to preset collections

- Use presets as reference for creating your own themed sets

Example:

    # Mix presets
    mixed <- c(emoji_presets()$christmas, emoji_presets()$love)
    emoji_shower_ui(emojis = mixed)

    # Extend a preset
    extended <- c(emoji_presets()$birthday, "cake", "cupcake", "champagne")
    emoji_shower_ui(emojis = extended)

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Use a preset
emoji_shower_ui(emojis = emoji_presets()$halloween)

# Or extract directly
presets <- emoji_presets()
presets$birthday
} # }
```
